A Research Project on Applying Logistic Regression to Predict Result of Diabetes Diagnosis
#### Introduction
The rise of Logistic Regression in machine learning stemmed from the need for a model capable of predicting categorical outcomes\cite{Acito2023}. Typically, these involve binary values like 0 and 1, representing opposing states like true/false, benign/malignant, or pregnant/not pregnant. Mastering Logistic Regression and its implementation paves the way for accurate solutions in classification problems, particularly those with binary outputs.

Diabetes mellitus encompasses a group of diseases disrupting the body's blood sugar utilization. Chronic diabetes, including types 1 and 2, often presents with similar symptoms that can go undiagnosed for years. These symptoms, which may appear suddenly, can include frequent urination, weight loss, thirst, fatigue, and vision changes. Regardless of the type, all diabetic conditions lead to an excess of blood glucose due to insulin deficiency, a hormone crucial for converting glucose into energy. High blood sugar poses a significant risk for various serious health complications.

Early diagnosis is crucial, yet traditional methods such as Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) often prove cumbersome. This research delves into the potential of Logistic Regression to accurately predict diabetes based on readily available data, potentially paving the way for more accessible and reliable diagnoses. Notably, predicting type 1 diabetes also relies on the Logistic Regression algorithm, aiming to estimate the probability of a patient receiving a diagnosis. This problem demands a binary output, where 1 indicates a type 1 diabetes diagnosis and 0 signifies its absence.
